# Stochastic LBFGS

This repository contains test code that combines the sLBFGS method "A Linearly-Convergent Stochastic L-BFGS Algorithm" (see http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.02087) with different line search/step size methods, which include "k-SVRG: Variance Reduction for Large Scale Optimization (see https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00982)" and "Probabilistic Line Searches for Stochastic Optimization" (see https://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/17-049/17-049.pdf). This test code allows the different optimization strategies to be run on a hacked version of the NRLB algorithm (Rastogi et al., PNAS 2018) and see their performance on a complex, high-condition number "real" machine learning problem.
